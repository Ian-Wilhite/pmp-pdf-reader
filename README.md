# pmp-pdf-reader

Order of the Arrow Performance Measurement Program PDF reader 1.1.4
Created by Ian Wilhite, G3 PMP Coordinator, 2024
updated 2/15/2024



## LIMITATIONS / USAGE:
this only views the ".pdf" files also located in the "Reports" folder, and will create the csv in the "PMP-PDF-READER" folder. This script is designed on the "PMP/JTE Detailed Worksheet" lodgemaster generated file (circa 2024). It also begins to fail on reports pre-2019.

## Instructions:
1) Download all reports and name files so that the first word of the file name is the name of the lodge (ex: "Wewikit 2024.pdf").
2) Place all files into the "Reports" folder (and remove the current files for G3 Lodges if outside G3)
3) Run the script and find the generated csv file - titled "G3_summary_csv"
4) Copy the [Google Sheet file for lodge evaluation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GkLFVnEPlIh2TqspDwS_hxvZjBEF9_Uc/edit#gid=2100894460)
5) Paste the csv file into the "raw_data" tab and verify the data gathered

## Background:
As of writing this, I am the G3 PMP coordinator, and i got really tired of copying all the data from the lodgemaster-generated pdfs into an excel sheet that I could actually compare the different lodges. The Performance Measurement Program (PMP) is a method created to evaluate a Lodge's performance as an organization and identify areas to improve. The 
I joked it might be faster for me to write a program to do it, so alas, bon apetit. If you are in a similar position in your lodge, section, or nationally, remember that the data only goes so far, and the real value in these positions is infomred decision making and goal setting.
