LIMITATIONS / USAGE:
this only views the ".pdf" files also located in the same folder as this script, and will create the 
csv in the same folder. This script is designed on the "PMP/JTE Detailed Worksheet" lodgemaster 
generated file (circa 2024). It also tends to begin to grab incorrect data on reports pre-2019.

INSTRUCTIONS:
download all reports and name files with the first word of the file name being the name of the lodge (case sensitive).
place all files into a single folder with the python script
run the script and find the generated csv file
paste the csv file into the excel sheet and verify data (the G3 and E3 are functionally identical) 

BACKGROUND:
as of writing this, I am the G3 PMP coordinator, and i got really tired of copying all the data 
from the lodgemaster-generated pdfs into an excel sheet that I could actually compare the different
lodges. I joked it might be faster for me to write a program to do it, so alas, bon apetit. If you 
are in a similar position in your lodge, section, or nationally, remember that the data only goes so 
far, and the real value in these positions is infomred decision making and goal setting.
